MagicCards
This app displays a list of cards (paginated), details of each card are viewable, also filtering cards by name and color.

This is a test project setted up with Expo.

Desktop view of this app is not available since it uses React-Native Modal which is not implemented for Web browsers.

Regarding the API, the contains filter doesn't work well and brings some cards without imageUrl, filtering is made by JavaScript to avoid this.
