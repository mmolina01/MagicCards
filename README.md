MagicCards
This app displays a list of cards (paginated), details of each card are viewable, also filtering cards by name and color.

This is a test project setted up with Expo.

Regarding the API, the contains filter doesn't work well and brings some cards without imageUrl, filtering is made by JavaScript to avoid this.
